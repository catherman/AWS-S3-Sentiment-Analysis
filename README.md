  1. Objective:  Engineer model for sentiment analysis of product reviews.
     
  1. Data:  Download Amazon Product Reviews from AWS’s Registry of Open Data.
     
  2. Data prep:  With pandas, seaborn, and sklearn to clean, transform, and export the data in preparation to train the data for a sentiment analysis algorithm.
      
  3. Visualize sentiment metrics with word cloud, violin plots, & bar charts.
     
  4. Take the first step in Data Lake formation, using AWS Glue & Athena to catalog metadata & query it using Athena. Use Jupyter’s custom magic capabilities/SQL to incorporate Athena’s query abilities.

1. Objective:  Use machine learning models to determine if observations are of a benign or malignant tumor.
     
2. Data: Breast cancer data.  Exploratory data analysis with visualization.  Data preparation:  Create a dummy classifier, train/test split. 

3. Models: Fit logistic regression, decision tree, & random forest. Analyze & visualize models' performance:  Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, & ROC/AUC.
